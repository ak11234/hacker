hacker
======
Download at https://github.com/ak11234/hacker/zipball/master and open setup.exe


Small simple fool-your-friends (FAKE) hacking app.

This app has a text box for an IP and two radio buttons (those all do nothing.)
Then you click a button which actually does something. It opens a window that loads a page at hackertyper.net.
(the window will look white for a while but it is just loading.)
When the window turns black and there is a green cursor you are ready.
Then you just press random keys and it types stuff.
Press the ALT key three times after a min or so.
Then just point at the screen and say "aha!"
Click the exit button.
Go to a website or logout of your computer or in some other way get to a login box for which you can login to and login.
Your freind(s) will think you just hacked the login and you saw the password when you pointed at the screen.

ENJOY :)
