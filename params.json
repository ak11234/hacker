It opens a window that loads a page at hackertyper.net.\r\n(the window will look white for a while but it is just loading.)\r\nWhen the window turns black and there is a green cursor you are ready.\r\nThen you just press random keys and it types stuff.\r\nPress the ALT key three times after a min or so.\r\nThen just point at the screen and say \"aha!\"\r\nClick the exit button.\r\nGo to a website or logout of your computer or in some other way get to a login box for which you can login to and login.\r\nYour freind(s) will think you just hacked the login and you saw the password when you pointed at the screen.\r\n\r\nENJOY :)\r\n\r\n\r\ncredit = hackertyper.net    (his github - @duiker101)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
